# Telegram Supplies Store

Implementation of a telegram bot web app store to help with taking orders of Arduinos and other electronics within SUTD. Completed in June 2022. Was based on [this](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps) functionality of telegram.

Integrates with a MongoDB database which could be viewed through a viewer hosted online myself.
